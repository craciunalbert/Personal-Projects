## About me

My name is Albert Craciun. As a results-oriented and collaborative team player, I am currently in the process of transitioning my career to apply my skills towards ensuring software functionality and usability as a Software Quality Assurance professional. With a successful 5-year career as a Sales Consultant in Bucharest, I have developed a keen understanding of customer needs and the importance of delivering high-quality solutions.
To further my knowledge in software testing, I have taken courses on ISTQB, Agile methodology, SQL, Python, and attended training on manual and automated testing. These courses have equipped me with a solid understanding of the key attributes of a QA Engineer, as well as proficiency in Jira management, test case creation and configuration, bug reporting, API testing with Postman, and GitHub repository management with Sourcetree.
As I seek to expand my knowledge and skills in a dynamic technology company, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the success of your organization as a QA Engineer. I am available for further discussion or to provide any additional information. Thank you for considering my candidacy for the open position.
